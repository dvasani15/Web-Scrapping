Wikipedia Web Scraping Project
Overview

This Python project demonstrates web scraping capabilities using the BeautifulSoup library and data manipulation with Pandas. It aims to retrieve data from Wikipedia's "List of largest companies in the United States by revenue" page and store it in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script (scrape_wikipedia.py) and this README file (README.md) to provide instructions and context.
Features

    Scrapes data from a specific Wikipedia page.
    Extracts information from a designated HTML table.
    Stores data in a structured Pandas DataFrame.
    Provides a starting point for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

    BeautifulSoup (beautifulsoup4)
    Requests (requests)
    Pandas (pandas)

Usage

    Define the target Wikipedia URL in the url variable within the scrape_wikipedia.py script.
    Run the script to retrieve and parse the data.
    Modify and extend the script to perform your desired data analysis and visualization tasks.
